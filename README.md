# Smart-Sound-Switch

We tend to ignore or forget a basic mobile etiquette to keep the mobile phones in silent mode at places like temples, churches, mosques, public meetings (assembly, parliament), hospitals, funeral grounds, theatres, your workplace, schools, colleges.., which sometimes put us in awkward situations.

To support all the users on sound mode management we have come up with an innovative solution to control sound mode switching through a mobile application. We plan to extend this facility to switch the sound mode for events that are stored in Google/Outlook calendar.
